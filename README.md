# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Approach

Machine Learning Models are widely used for detecting the malware in the computer.
We can classify the executable files in the two categories they are legitimate and the malicious
files. This machine learning models detect the malicious PE files automatically after the training
with the better accuracy saving time and efforts as compare to traditional methods. We can avoid
the human errors while detecting the malicious file because the Machine Learning Models are
detecting the malicious file only after the detailed study of the file which we want to check is it
malicious or not.
This approach can be used in many places where we want more accuracy in less time, or
we can say the sensitive areas where detecting malware is not only the main task to follow with it
we also have to consider other situations, situations which are delegated and we canâ€™t
compromise with it.
